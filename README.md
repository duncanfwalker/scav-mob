Scavenger Mobile 
========

Scavenger Mobile helps you use the gift economy website Scavenger.org.uk. It allows people to quickly share photos of the stuff they want to give away.

The app is written with Backbone.js. It uses the PhoneGap framework to access the phones camera, storage and GPS and syncs with Scavenger.org.uk through a RESTful api.

See the Scavenger wiki for more information on getting involved:
